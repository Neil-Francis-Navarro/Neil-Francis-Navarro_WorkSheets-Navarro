#Based on the above vector LETTERS:
# a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
LETTERS[1:11]
#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
letters[1:26 %% 2!= 0]
#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
#Based on the above vector letters:
vletters <- LETTERS [c(1,5,9,15,21)]
vletters


#Based on the above vector letters:
#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
letters[21:26]
#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
letters[15:24]

#2.
#a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

city <- c("Tuguegarao City","Manila","Iloilo City","Tacloban","Samal Island","Davao City")

city
#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.
#Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what
#is in the instruction.

tempt <- c(42,39,34,34,30,27)
tempt
#c. Associate the temperature temp with the city by using names() function. What is
#the R code and its result?
names(tempt) <- city
tempt

#d. From the answer in c, what is the content of index 5 and index 6? What is its R code?
tempt[5:6] 

#2. Create a matrix of one to eight and eleven to fourteen #with four columns and three
#rows.

#a. What will be the R code for the #2 question and its #result?
x <- matrix(data = c(1:8,11:14),3,4)
x

#b. Multiply the matrix by two. What is its R code and its result?
x*2

#c. What is the content of row 2? What is its R code?
x[2,]
#d. What will be the R code if you want to display the #column 3 and column 4 in row 1 and row 2? What is its #output?
x[c(1,2),c(3,4)]
#e. What is the R code is you want to display only the #columns in 2 and 3, row 3? What
#is its output?
x[c(3),c(2,3)]

#f. What is the R code is you want to display only the #columns 4? What is its output?
x[,4]
#g. Name the rows as isa, dalawa, tatlo and columns as uno, #dos, tres, quatro
#for the matrix that was created in b.‘. What is its R code #and corresponding output?
dimnames(x) <- list(c("isa", "dalawa", "tatlo"),c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro"))

#h. From the original matrix you have created in a, reshape #the matrix by assigning a
#new dimension with dim(). New dimensions should have 2 #columns and 6 rows. What will
#be the R code and its output?
dim(x) <- c(6,2)
x

#3. An array contains 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1
#a. Create an array for the above numeric values. Each values will be repeated twice # What will be the R
#code if you are to create a three-dimensional array with 4 columns and 2 rows. What will be its output?

array_data <- c(1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5, 1)
array_data

val <- array(rep(array_data, 2), dim = c(2,4,3))
val


#c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. The array
# names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimenstional Array”, and “3rd-Dimensional Array”.
# What will be the R codes and its output?
